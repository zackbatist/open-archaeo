[_Hyde-hyde_](https://github.com/htr3n/hyde-hyde) is a responsive [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) theme inspired by @spf13's [Hyde](https://github.com/spf13/hyde.git) and its variant [Nate Finch's blog](https://npf.io). It was heavily restructured with modularised page layouts for easier maintenance and modification. _Hyde-hyde_ offers awesome features such as nice colour tone, [code highlighting](https://highlightjs.org), [Font-Awesome 5's sidebar icons](https://fontawesome.com)), a cool portfolio page, more choices for commenting (e.g. [GraphComment](https://graphcomment.com), [Disqus](https://disqus.com)).
